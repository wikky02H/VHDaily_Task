1.	What are INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, CROSS JOIN and SELF JOIN?

INNER JOIN:
  ->Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables being joined.

LEFT JOIN:
  -> Returns all the rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. 
     If there is no matching row in the right table, then it returns NULL values for the right table columns.

RIGHT JOIN:
 -> Returns all the rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table. 
    If there is no matching row in the left table, then it returns NULL values for the left table columns.

FULL OUTER JOIN:
 ->Returns all the rows from both tables and NULL values for the columns that do not have a matching row in the other table.

CROSS JOIN
 -> Returns the Cartesian(CROSS) product of both tables, meaning all possible combinations of rows from both tables.

SELF JOIN
 -> A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.
