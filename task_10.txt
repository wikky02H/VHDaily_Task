1. Why try catch block is needed?

    =>It`s a feature of PHP's exception-handling mechanism. It is used to handle errors or exceptions that occur during the execution of PHP code.

    =>In PHP, an exception is an object that represents an error or an exceptional event that occurs during the execution of code.
    =>When an exception is thrown, it interrupts the normal flow of the program and transfers control to an exception handler.

    =>The try-catch block is used to enclose code that may throw an exception.
                ->The "try" block contains the code that may generate an exception.
                ->The "catch" block contains the code that handles the exception.

    When an exception is thrown in the "try" block,
    =>PHP immediately transfers control to the first matching "catch" block.
    =>The code in the "catch" block can then handle the exception by performing any necessary cleanup or error recovery operations.

    =>Using try-catch blocks can help make your code more robust and reliable, as it provides a structured way to handle errors and exceptions that may occur during the execution of your code.
    =>It allows you to gracefully handle unexpected situations, such as a failed database connection or a missing file, without crashing your application or causing other unexpected behavior.

2.What is primary key and foreign key in a table?

=>A PRIMARY KEY:
            ->A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table.
            ->It must have a unique value for each record in the table and cannot be null.
            ->Laravel uses an auto-incrementing integer as the primary key for new tables, By default.

=>A FOREIGN KEY:
            ->A foreign key is a field in a table that refers to the primary key of another table.
            ->It is used to create relationships between tables.
            ->The foreign key column in one table references the primary key column of another table.
            ->By doing this, we can create a relationship between two tables.

=>By using primary and foreign keys, we can ensure the integrity and consistency of our data, and
  create relationships between tables that can be used to perform powerful queries.
