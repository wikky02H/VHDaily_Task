question:   what are aggregate functions?

ans:

Aggregate functions are functions in a database management system that perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value as the result.
These functions are used to summarize or aggregate data in a database table.

There are several common aggregate functions that are used in database management systems, including:

    COUNT() - returns the number of rows in a table, or the number of rows that meet a specified condition.

    SUM() - returns the sum of a column.

    AVG() - returns the average value of a column.

    MAX() - returns the maximum value of a column.

    MIN() - returns the minimum value of a column.

In summary, aggregate functions allow you to perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value as the result,
making it easier to analyze and summarize large sets of data.
