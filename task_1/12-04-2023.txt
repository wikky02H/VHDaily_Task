1. client and server

Client(client request Operations on resource):
      
       The client is known as the end-user, each time user sends a request from the client side and the request hits API and does its task.
server(server host resource):
      
       The server contains permanent databases and files are stored. the request gets from the client side and hits API.based on API tasks like CRED operations are happening  



2. REST API
      APIs that implement REST constraints
          RE->Representational 
          S->State 
          T->Transfer
->REST API is a type of web API.that use HTTP requests to perform an operation on data

->API uses HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) to manipulate the resource. 
       For example: a GET request to a user's URI would retrieve the user's information, 
                    while a POST request to the same URI would create a new user.

->REST APIs typically return data in a format such as JSON or another format, which allows the data to be easily consumed by client applications.

->Advantages and popularity depend on  their simplicity, scalability, and flexibility

->In a RESTful API, each resource (user or a product) is identified by a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
